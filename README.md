# Calculator

## Objective

To create a browser version of a calculator using HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. Full details can be found on [The Odin Project's page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

### Specifications

**Requirements**

1. The calculator should have all the basic math functions:
    * Add
    * Subtract
    * Multiply
    * Divide

2. The calculator should include a display screen and buttons for:
    * Each digit
    * Each of the above functions
    * An "Equals" key
    * A "Clear" key

The calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. For instance, if the calculation was `12 + 7 - 5` then the calculator should first do `12 + 7`, display the result of that calculation (`19`), then use it as the first number in the next calculation (`19 - 5`).

**Optional**

1. Allow users to enter floating point numbers, but make sure the decimal button is disabled if there's already one in the display

2. Use CSS to make the calculator look nice

3. Add a "backspace" button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number

4. Add keyboard support
